      <description>About I am a software engineering intern at Cockroach Labs. I have previously worked at Facebook, Uber ATG and the CMU Software Engineering Institute.
I recently completed my undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science.
You can find my CV here.
Research I&amp;rsquo;m broadly interested in algorithms, computer systems, and programming languages. My recent research focuses on the intersection of these fields, in the topic of parallel computing.</description>
