      <description>About I am a computer science PhD Candidate at Stanford University working on parallel and distributed systems, currently rotating with Alex Aiken. Before that, I was a software engineer at Cockroach Labs working on CockroachDB. I am fortunate to be supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
Outside of work, you can find me lifting weights, playing tennis, and over eating.
My resume is available here.
Research I&amp;rsquo;m broadly interested in algorithms, computer systems, and programming languages.</description>
