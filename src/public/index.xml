      <title>PhD Lesson: Prototyping Your Prototypes</title>

      <description>As I become an older and grumpier PhD student (I&amp;rsquo;m almost halfway through my fourth year!), I wanted to begin documenting some lessons that I have learned along the way to maximize effectiveness and the overall rate of progress. This lesson is more focused to PhD students doing systems related research, but perhaps future posts will be more applicable to other domains as well.
As a systems researcher, the main way to iterate on and validate our ideas is to build software prototypes that implement the proposed system, programming language or more.</description>

      <description>Modern machines are increasing in their complexity: it is common to have multiple GPUs attached to a single node, and multiple GPU-accelerated nodes connected by different interconnects throughout the memory hierarchy, such as NVLink within a single node and Infiniband across multiple nodes. As machines have become more complicated, developing software that achieves high performance on these machines has also become more difficult than before. Programmers must reason about how their program data is partitioned and distributed across GPUs and how to utilize the proper communication APIs to move data between memories in their machine, all while overlapping as much computation with data movement as possible.</description>

      <description>About I am a computer science PhD student at Stanford University, working on compilers and parallel programming systems. I am advised by Alex Aiken and Fredrik Kjolstad. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m a research intern at Nvidia working with Michael Garland and Mike Bauer on Legate. Before that, I was a software engineer at Cockroach Labs helping to build CockroachDB. I am fortunate to be supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and an NVIDIA Graduate Fellowship.</description>
