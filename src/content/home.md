# About

I am a software engineering intern at [Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/).
I have previously worked at Facebook, Uber ATG and the CMU Software Engineering Institute.

I recently completed my undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science.

You can find my CV [here](rohan_resume.pdf).

# Research

I'm broadly interested in algorithms, computer systems, and programming languages.
My recent research focuses on the intersection of these fields, in the topic of parallel computing.
I was fortunate for the opportunity to be advised by [Umut Acar](http://www.umut-acar.org/) and to work with [Sam Westrick](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~swestric/) at Carnegie Mellon on these topics.

# Teaching

At Carnegie Mellon, I was a teaching assistant
for [Principles of Functional Programming](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/), and 
a multiple time head teaching assistant for
[Parallel and Sequential Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15210/).

Additionally, I contributed to the starting and development of the
[Diderot](http://www.umut-acar.org/diderot) project, a new educational 
platform developed at Carnegie Mellon that is used by over 500 students daily.
I develop and manage the cloud infrastructure for the project.
