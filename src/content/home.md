# About

I am a software engineer at 
[Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) working
on the SQL execution team.
I previously was an intern at Cockroach Labs on the same team.
I have spent time at Uber self-driving working on
systems/cloud infrastructure, and
Facebook, where I worked on networks.
I recently finished my undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University.
Take a look at my [resume](rohan_resume.pdf)!

# Research

I'm broadly interested in algorithms, computer systems, and programming languages.
My recent research focuses on the intersection of these fields, in the topic of parallel computing.
My research aims to present parallel algorithms for difficult problems, and to create
efficient, easy to use, and scalable systems to programmers to write parallel code.
I was fortunate for the opportunity to be advised by [Umut Acar](http://www.umut-acar.org/) and to work with [Sam Westrick](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~swestric/) at Carnegie Mellon on these topics.

Previous projects I have been involved with include parallel algorithms for
[subgraph isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgraph_isomorphism_problem),
memory management systems for parallel functional languages,
and parallel functional sequence data structures.


## Publications

* Disentanglement, Theory and Practice. 
Undergraduate Thesis.

* Brief Announcement: A Parallel Algorithm for Subgraph Isomorphism, 
ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA) 2019.

# Teaching

At Carnegie Mellon, I served as a teaching assistant
for [Principles of Functional Programming](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/), and 
a multiple time head teaching assistant for
[Parallel and Sequential Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15210/).

Additionally, I contributed to the starting and development of the
[Diderot](http://www.umut-acar.org/diderot) project, a new educational 
platform developed at Carnegie Mellon that is used by over 500 students and faculty daily.
I develop and manage the cloud infrastructure for the project on an ongoing basis.
