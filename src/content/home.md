# About

I am a computer science PhD student at Stanford University,
advised by [Alex Aiken](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/)
and [Fredrik Kjolstad](http://fredrikbk.com/). Before that, I was a software engineer at 
[Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) working on 
[CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach).
I am fortunate to be supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

Outside of work, you can find me lifting weights, playing tennis, 
[cooking](https://www.instagram.com/the_wizard_of_zoz/) and (over) eating.

My resume is available [here](rohan_resume.pdf).

# Research

I'm broadly interested in programming languages and computer systems.
My recent research focuses on the intersection of these fields, in the topic of parallel computing.

I was fortunate for the opportunity to be advised by [Umut Acar](http://www.umut-acar.org/) and 
to work with [Sam Westrick](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~swestric/) at Carnegie Mellon on these topics.

Some projects I've worked on include:
* Automatic mapping of computation and data onto heterogenous architectures
* Memory management systems for parallel functional languages
* Parallel algorithms for [subgraph isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgraph_isomorphism_problem)
* Parallel functional sequence data structures

## Publications

* Disentanglement in Nested-Parallel Programs, 
ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) 2020.

* Disentanglement, Theory and Practice. 
Undergraduate Thesis.

# Teaching

At Carnegie Mellon, I served as a teaching assistant
for [Principles of Functional Programming](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/), and 
a multiple time head teaching assistant for
[Parallel and Sequential Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15210/).

Additionally, I contributed to the starting and development of the
[Diderot](http://www.umut-acar.org/diderot) project, a new educational 
platform developed at Carnegie Mellon that is used by over 500 students and faculty daily.
I develop and manage the cloud infrastructure for the project on an ongoing basis.
