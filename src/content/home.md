# About

I am a computer science PhD student at Stanford University,
working on compilers and parallel programming systems. I am
advised by [Alex Aiken](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/)
and [Fredrik Kjolstad](http://fredrikbk.com/). Currently,
I'm a research intern at Nvidia working with [Michael Garland](https://mgarland.org/)
and [Mike Bauer](https://lightsighter.org/) on [Legate](https://github.com/nv-legate). 
Before that, I was a software engineer at 
[Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) helping to build
[CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach).
I am fortunate to be supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

Outside of work, you can find me lifting weights, playing [tennis](https://clubtennis.stanford.edu/), 
[cooking](https://www.instagram.com/the_wizard_of_zoz/) and (over) eating.

My resume is available [here](rohan_resume.pdf).

# Research

I'm broadly interested in programming languages and computer systems.
My recent research focuses on the intersection of these fields, in the topic of parallel computing.

I also worked in this area at Carnegie Mellon, where I collaborated with [Sam Westrick](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~swestric/)
and was advised by [Umut Acar](http://www.umut-acar.org/).

Some projects I've worked on include:
* Compiling tensor algebra DSLs to supercomputers
* Automatic mapping of computation and data onto heterogenous architectures
* Memory management systems for parallel functional languages
* Parallel algorithms for [subgraph isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgraph_isomorphism_problem)
* Parallel functional sequence data structures

# Teaching

At Carnegie Mellon, I served as a teaching assistant
for [Principles of Functional Programming](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/), and 
a multiple time head teaching assistant for
[Parallel and Sequential Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15210/).
At Stanford, I've been a CA for [Programming Languages](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs242/).

Additionally, I contributed to the starting and development of the
[Diderot](http://www.umut-acar.org/diderot) project, a new educational 
platform developed at Carnegie Mellon that is used by over 500 students and faculty daily.
I develop and manage the cloud infrastructure for the project on an ongoing basis.
